  pc: `This is my PC. I work mostly in JavaScript/TypeScript/C++ these days.  
I've made some games in that language. I also like to make websites.  
Anyway, regardless of the language, I just like programming.  
I also like to learn new things. I'm currently learning Golang.  
<br> The Frameworks & Libraries I use are:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS, Astro, Next.js

  "cs-degree": `I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering 3rd-year student.  
Gonna hang the degree here later, but I also have knowledge of CS fundamentals like:  
  
Data Structures & Algorithms, DBMS, MySQL, Computer Networking, OOPs, Operating Systems`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch TV sometimes to unwind. Meanwhile, you guys can check out my achievements and certificates for different courses I've completed or taken so far:

  Contact me if you have any interesting opportunities!`,
  projects: `Info about this portfolio: It's made with the Kaboom.js library, which is used for making games in JavaScript.  
It also uses tiles for rendering the environment and is built with Vite for fast development and bundling.  
Text is rendered with HTML/CSS, meaning the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within the canvas.  

The process included designing maps using Tiled, implementing player movement, handling collisions,  
displaying dialogue, scaling the camera, and adding animations for a polished experience.`,
  library: ` I enjoy building things, especially **interactive & innovative projects**.
